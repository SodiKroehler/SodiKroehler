- 👋 Hi, I’m @SodiKroehler
- 👀 I’m interested in alternative aspects of artificial intelligence - mainly ethics, creativity, and memory storage. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying computer science at Pitt University.
- 💞️ All of the projects here so far are done entirely by me. However, I would love to collaborate if you should find something interesting, or if you need help at all :)
- 📫 How to reach me: carrier pigeon is best - I am three hops from Mr. Berniwisky's Chamber in an easterlyward direction. Alternatively, email me at sodikroehler@gmail.com.
