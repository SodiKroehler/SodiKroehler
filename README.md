- 👋 Hi, I’m @SodiKroehler
- 👀 I study algorithmic ethics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for my Masters in Computer Science at Pitt University, and am advised by Dr. Yuru Lin, Dr. Stephen Lee, and Dr. Lorraine Li.
- 💞️ There are a few public archives of projects where I have collaborated with others, however all active projects are currently solo ones. Some of them show poor coding, please do not look at them.
- 📫 How to reach me: carrier pigeon is best - I am three hops from Mr. Berniwisky's Chamber in an easterlyward direction. If there are unfavorable winds, you could also try emailing me at sodikroehler@gmail.com.
