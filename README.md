- 👋 Hi, I’m @SodiKroehler
- 👀 I’m interested in alternative aspects of artificial intelligence - mainly ethics, creativity, and memory storage. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying computer science at Pitt University.
- 💞️ There are a few public archives of projects where I have collaborated with others, however all active projects are currently solo ones. Should any of these tickle your fancy, though, or else if in the course of your life you come upon the dreadful realization that someone as lowly as I may be of assistance, be sure to give me a hoot and/or holler and I shall come at once.
- 📫 How to reach me: carrier pigeon is best - I am three hops from Mr. Berniwisky's Chamber in an easterlyward direction. If there are unfavorable winds, you could also try emailing me at sodikroehler@gmail.com.
